# Rosalind Bioinformatics Problems

This is where I store my answers to the Bioinformatics Problems found on Rosalind.info solved using Python

## Bioinformatics Stronghold
These problems focus on the algorithms underlying a variety of bioinformatics topics:
- computational mass spectrometry
- alignment 
- dynamic programming
- genome assembly
- genome rearrangements
- phylogeny
- probability
- string algorithms

My answers to these problems can be found in /Bioinformatics_Stronghold
