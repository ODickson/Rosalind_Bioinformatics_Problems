# Rosalind Bioinformatics Problems

Rosalind.info contains computational problems of varying difficulty that are extracted from real challenges of molecular biology. This is where I store my answers to the Bioinformatics Problems found on Rosalind.info solved using Python

## [Bioinformatics Stronghold](/Bioinformatics_Stronghold)
These problems focus on the algorithms underlying a variety of bioinformatics topics:
- computational mass spectrometry
- alignment 
- dynamic programming
- genome assembly
- genome rearrangements
- phylogeny
- probability
- string algorithms
